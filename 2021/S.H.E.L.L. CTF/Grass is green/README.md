Question:
<pre>
Grass can be green but it can be brown as well. so lions can hide in between them
Note : Wrap the flag in 'SHELL{' & '}'
</pre>

files: [grass_is_green.jpg](grass_is_green.jpg)

1) opening the file it looks like our familiar dark elf
2) based on the wording i'm assuming this has to do with the green color filter
3) `stegsolve.jar`
4) gray bits shows some weirdness on the top left corner

5) cycling through filters, eventually i get to green and see the flag
