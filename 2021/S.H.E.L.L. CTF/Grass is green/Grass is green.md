Question:
<pre>
Grass can be green but it can be brown as well. so lions can hide in between them
Note : Wrap the flag in 'SHELL{' & '}'

files: grass_is_green.jpg

1) opening the file it looks like our familiar dark elf
2) based on the wording i'm assuming this has to do with the green color filter
3) `stegsolve.jar`
4) gray bits shows some weirdness on the top left corner
