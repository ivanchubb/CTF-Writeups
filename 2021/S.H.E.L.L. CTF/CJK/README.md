Question: 
There is a locker protected with a pin.  

Can you help me out in finding the pin in the image, and there is some labeling side of it.

Note : flag is not in SHELL{} format, just a positive number.
- file has 3 symbols seperated by "+", since the question specifies the answer is a positive number, assume the plus symbols means add them.

1) google "CJK" = Chinese, Japanese, Korean
2) screenshot and reverse image search characters as individuals. All can be found [online easily](https://charbase.com/block/cjk-symbols-and-punctuation)
3) 1st one is Post office U+3036
4) 2nd one is Japanese Industrial Standard symbol U+3004
5) 3rd one is Geta Mark U+3013
6) 3036+3004+3013 = 9053
7) **flag: 9053**
