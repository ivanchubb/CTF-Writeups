question:

<pre>can you decrypt this text : "ZOLSS{W1G\_D3HY\_4\_T45R}"

NOTE: do not shift the numbers and the special charecters( '{' , '}' , '\_' ).
</pre>
based on special character format looks like a substitution cipher.  since the start is ZOLSS, it's probably just a shift otherwise the "LL" in SHELL would be different characters.  
1) put into caeser solver and find it's a +7 shift
**SHELL{P1Z\_W3AR\_4\_M45K}**
