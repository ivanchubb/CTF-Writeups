## S.H.E.L.L. CTF

Categories:
1) Puzzle
2) Forensics
3) Cryptography
4) Reverse Engineering
5) Web Security


This was my first CTF competing with a partner.  Between the two of us we managed 3544 points and placed 23rd of 533 teams. We managed to complete the entire forensics, web security, and reverse engineering category. The only ones we couldn't solve were 3 cryptography questions and one puzzle question (Cyber Attack 3).
