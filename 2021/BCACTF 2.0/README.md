- Unfortunately this time around I didn't really have the time to commit a whole weekend to the CTF.  I did pop in and out intermittently and managed to scoop up a few easy ones and 1525 points overall.  Hopefully when this is held next year i can commit more time to it and go through the challenges a bit more thuroughly.
