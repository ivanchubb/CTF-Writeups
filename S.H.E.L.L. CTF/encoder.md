question:

<pre>can you decrypt this text : "ZOLSS{W1G_D3HY_4_T45R}"

NOTE: do not shift the numbers and the special charecters( '{' , '}' , '_' ).
</pre>
Based on special character format looks like a substitution cipher.  since the start is ZOLSS, it's probably just a shift otherwise the "LL" in SHELL would be different characters.  
1) put into caeser solver and find it's a +7 shift
**SHELL{P1Z_W3AR_4_M45K}**
