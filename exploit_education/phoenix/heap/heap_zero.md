## Solution

Very similiarly to the basic stack overflow exercises we must overflow `d` and overwrite `f->fp`

1. What happens with normal input: ![](img/heap_zero_0.png)
2. Increase the "A" until it changes: ![](img/heap_zero_1.png)
3. Find Where exactly it changes: ![](img/heap_zero_2.png)
4. Now that we know where we are writing to, figure out what to write with `objdump -t /opt/phoenix/i486/heap-zero | grep "winner"` ![](img/heap_zero_3.png)
5. Add it as the address in little endian and solve the challenge: ![](img/heap_zero_solve.png)
